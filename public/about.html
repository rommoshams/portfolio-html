<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I am Rommo Shams. An explorer, an adventurer and a dreamer. Sounds like a movie description but that's the phase I am currently going through so. 
</p>

<p>I have been realised that learning programming and coding. i.e. to break into the technical world would be the next important thing for me. As I want to be a tech startup founder and without the knowledge of tech, it's quite a dream. And only idea is not good enough, execution is important too. And that's why I am now on the journey of learning programming and get out of my comfort zone. </p>

<p>Let's see how far i go but i know i need to try. Because if not now, then when? Welcome to witness my journey, welcome to My Portfolio!</p>
